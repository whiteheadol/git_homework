Clear and consistent communication is incredibly important for success.
Know when it is appropriate to ask for help and when you should keep working through something on your own.

I want to try the Driver/Navigator exercise more often. It has been helpful in helping me commit things to memory so far.
I am also committed to maintaining my calendar system. Specifically, breaking larger tasks into smaller blocks.

Shoutout to Amy Holt for helping me with my computer setup. I had trouble with Homebrew right off the bat, and she was a wonderful resource for getting me back on track.

I enjoy the collaboration aspect of the breakout groups, and it's interesting getting to meet new people each time!
